graph-o-sort
============

analyze sorting algorithms by putting them in a neat graph, using PYTHON

Simple implementations of sorting algorithms that log their progress in a neato graph.
I've got no idea what your purpose to use this might be. I use these structures for
algorithmic composition.

Needs graphviz, pydot and this kind of stuff ... i forgot, really ...
